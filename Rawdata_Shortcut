# Data Description & Source
## Dataset Overview
This project uses the **Enron Email Dataset**, a large-scale corpus of internal corporate email communications that has been widely used in research on organizational networks, social network analysis, and machine learning.
- **Approximate size**: ~500,000 email messages  
- **Users**: ~150 Enron employees (primarily senior management)  
- **Data type**: Raw email text (headers + body)

## Data Source
The raw data used in this project was obtained from the Kaggle distribution of the Enron email corpus:
- **Kaggle dataset**: *The Enron Email Dataset*  
- **Uploader**: William Cukierski  
- **URL**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset
The Enron email corpus was originally made public during the **U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)** investigation into Enron Corporation and later prepared for research use through initiatives such as the **CALO Project**.

## Data Usage in This Project
The dataset is used as **raw communication logs** to construct a directed, weighted email communication network.
Key preprocessing steps include:
- Removal of system-generated emails (e.g., auto-replies, newsletters, calendar notifications)
- Filtering of extremely short messages to reduce low-signal interactions
- Extraction of reply-based response times using sender–receiver matching
- Aggregation of emails into network edges weighted by communication frequency

No external labels (e.g., performance ratings, job titles, or organizational hierarchy) are used in the analysis.
