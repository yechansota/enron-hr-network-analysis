HR Analytics | Network-Based Bottleneck Diagnostics & Simulation
================================================================================

Author: Sean Kim
Project: Enron Organizational Network Analysis (HR Analytics Perspective)

Description:
- Translates large-scale email communication data into organizational risk signals
- Focuses on structural bottlenecks, workload concentration, and fragility
- Avoids individual ranking; emphasizes system-level diagnostics
- Validates findings via simulation (stress tests)

Pipeline:
1. ETL + Noise Reduction + Reply-based Response Time
2. Directed, Weighted Network Construction
3. Macro Diagnostics (Communities, Openness, Sluggishness)
4. Macro Simulation (Fragmentation Impact)
5. Micro Role Signals (Load Absorbers, Connectors)
6. Micro Simulation (Key Operator Stress Test)
7. HR-Readable Interpretation & Actions

Note:
- Network metrics are diagnostic indicators, not evidence of intent or misconduct.
